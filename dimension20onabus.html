<p><strong>Marovitch’s season started out as a joke, and, in a way, it ended as one. </strong>The story begins with an incoherent skit about a bus exploding and it lands with that same bus getting elected as President of LAX. Pretty much as surreal as it gets. </p>
<br>
<p>And yet, we feel it is important to take a moment to analyze it, understand not just <em>that</em> it worked very well, but <em>why</em>. </p>
<br>
<p>We are not trying to say that the scope of this campaign went further than what Katie has outright stated. <u>This is no ACOC,</u> and it certainly did not keep the players up at night, replaying with gravitas a particular memory. This season says nothing particularly groundbreaking about serious topics and it should not be expected to. It’s good-hearted, hilarious escapism, and we should appreciate it for what it is. </p>
<br>
<p>The secret weapon of <em>Dimension 20: on a Bus</em> can be traced back to its strange, endearing mechanics. As a campaign, this story has expanded the limits of what TRPG can do. <strong>Dropout’s two souls</strong> (short form, comedy improv and structured, character-based roleplaying) <strong>have finally transformed into a secret third thing. </strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Alright, let’s backtrack a bit and recap what this campaign is about. </p>
<br>
<p><em>(The next section is going to contain spoilers. If you want our opinion, however, spoilers are not going to ruin your experience of the story. Its plot –especially the parts we have chosen to describe— is the least interesting thing about it.) </em></p>
<br>
<p>The first episode is almost entirely nonsensical. The players seem unsure about the direction Katie is taking them and the length of the season (16 full hours) becomes increasingly hard to conceptualize. Towards the end of the session, however, something meaningful finally happens, and the players manage to prove that there is <em>some </em>coherency to the DM’s actions. Almost an hour in, Jasmine Bhullar has the final revelation: <strong>what if they stopped looking at Katie as a DM, and started treating her like another character? </strong></p>
<br>
<p>To make a long story short, Katie’s role here is not strictly that of a DM. She voices NPCs and administers dice rolls, but she is also playing an in-world character: a random deity, tasked to take on her first job as an “Overseer”.</p>
<p>According to a nebulous and never again revisited supernatural system, life on earth is split into many different parallel universes and each of them is under the care of a minor god, the aforementioned ‘Overseer’. </p>
<p>Katie’s character is called “Katy” and she is trying to have some fun in a deeply boring existence. <strong>Her job is to watch over Earth ‘A Thousand’ and — if the time calls for it — influence its destiny. </strong></p>
<p>At first glance, she assumes that humanity’s main life form is cars (“there’s so many of them!”) and immediately makes it her goal to appoint one of the buses (“the bigger, stronger cars!”) as  the President of the Los Angeles International Airport. To achieve this goal, she opens communication with what she perceives to be some of the bus’s most intimate friends: a few objects scattered on the worn-out seats. That’s how an m&m, a top-hat, a little army man and lint suddenly become sentient.</p>
<br>
<p>Katy realises the car/human mix-up pretty early, but she refuses to readjust her aim. Our crew, forced to reckon with a newfound existence, begins playing Katy’s “game”. As they start interacting with her strange, world-bending rules, the players unravel the inner workings of the infamous “bus” — which keeps exploding and teleporting at different LA intersections. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>This campaign is quite literally a <em>game changer</em>, played without any knowledge of its rules. </strong>It’s an extended bit hidden in plain sight as a 14 hour long puzzle. As the story goes forward, however, something special happens: things get so silly that they start coming off as sincere. The gang’s trip becomes an excuse to ponder about humanity and the things that make us “simply happy”. </p>
<br>
<p><u>As we have written in the past,</u> certain D20 campaigns (Brennan’s especially) are full of underutilized potential. ‘Fantasy High: Senior Year” is the example we feel most confident about. The rat grinders could have been unforgettable NPCs, but their growth was confined by the table’s unwillingness to take them seriously. The story starts somewhat grand, but then one joke leads to another and much of the substance gets lost along the way, leaving behind a series of questionable narrative choices. </p>
<br>
<p>“Dimension 20: On a Bus” follows the same trajectory, in reverse. <strong>Yes, it starts off deeply unserious, but it brings about a kind of natural synergy that begs to be filled with emotion.</strong> The top hat, the m&m, the little army and lint form a genuine friendship, <em>chosen</em> and <em>wanted</em> in a world full of chaos. </p>
<hr>
<p>Marovitch’s campaign follows the structure of a well thought-out improv show, bound by whichever rules were deemed the funniest. Truth be told, few of us could create something as directionless and end up with a well made, watchable product, and maybe that's the point. This season shows us something that no, maybe <em>we</em> cannot do, but that we are quite happy to see professionals execute. </p>

<p>There are surely many reasons why this season ended up working as well as it did, but it’s no coincidence that all the players are DMs. <strong>This is a world shaped by five people according to some very loose points of references, and it works spectacularly. </strong>It’s the balancing act of the year. </p>
<br>
<p>Maybe, to quote Bluey (Aabria Lyengar’s character), that’s the thing we love about the things we love. <em>They trick us into having a good time. </em></p>
